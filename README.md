INTRODUCTION:

The repository ADM_H1 contains the code from Problems 1 and 2 of Homework 1 for the course of Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (Master of Data Science 22/23 University of La Sapienza).

FILES CONTAINED:
- 1. The file ADM_HOMEWORK1_JAVIER_MARTINEZ.pynb contains a Jupyter Notebook with all structured code of Problems 1 and 2. At the begging there is a introductory disclaimer in which I mention all challenges that I couldn't do enterely on my own, and required to seek for help in Hacker Rank's Discussion Forum.
- 2. The file Submissions_Merged.pdf contains screenshots of HackerRank's submissions tab, in order to show that all challenges were completed.
