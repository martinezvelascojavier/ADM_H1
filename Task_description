Instructions
You must hand in the homeworks electronically and before the due date and time.
The first homework has to be done by each person individually.
Handing in:
You have to create a public Github repository, that you are going to share with using a google

Problem 1. The goal of the first assignment focuses on building up your skills on Python. The
assignment is done electronically using the HACKERRANK online service available from the following
URL:
https://www.hackerrank.com
You must create an account and complete as many challenges as you can from the list included
below. When you are finished and want to submit your assignment, from the hackerrank site, go
to the submissions page under your profile and produce a PDF printout. This is available from the
following url:
https://www.hackerrank.com/submissions/all
Your solutions must include as attachment:
• The pdf file that you created.
• The Python code of your solutions, clearly organized.
Don’t forget to check the collaboration policy at the course web page. To summarize,
you can discuss with each other, but the writing at the end should be yours.
In addition, you should preferably not look at the solutions provided by HACKERRANK;
if you do so, you should explicitly mention it in the corresponding response.
